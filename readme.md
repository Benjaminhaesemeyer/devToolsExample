Finding and fixing the Reference Error in console:

After inspecting the page, and checking the console, i found a Reference Error.
The error stated that the variable showGlobal was not defined in the script.js.
I went through the script.js file and searched for any variables that was similar to the one that was undefined.
This is where i discovered that showGlobal was actually the variable showGloabals and the "s" was missing from the text.
